# Log for what we did today!

# First step of the day
$ rails g migration CreateAuthorsBooksJoinTable

# orders in sort order (authors before books)

# Now we're gonna make some changes before migration, check git history before aaeb658

# At commit aaeb658 we ran:
$ rake db:migrate

# Didn't commit our next changes yet, but let's play with the console
$ rails c

> @author = Author.new
> @author.first_name = "David Foster"
> @author.last_name = "Wallace"
> @author.save

> @book = Book.new
> @book.title = "Infinite Jest"
# > @book
# > @book.authors
> @book.authors = [@author]
> @book.save

> @author.books
> @book.authors

> @book.authors.each do |author|
>   puts "#{author.first_name} #{author.last_name}"
> end

> @book.authors.first
> @book.authors.first.first_name

# Exit the console

$ rails g model User last_name:string first_name:string email:string
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails g model Role level:string
