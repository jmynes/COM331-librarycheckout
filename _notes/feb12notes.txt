# How most professionals do it, generating a model rather than scaffold
# Remember adage: Convention Over Configuration


# Create migration file
$   rails g model Book title:string

# And now update the schema file
$   rake db:migrate

# No views or controllers exist yet, no routes to find.

# Added last_name, intentionally forgot first_name:string
$   rails g model Author last_name:string

# This generated db/migrate/20180212235656_create_authors.rb

# Oh no! We "forgot" first_name:string! Quick, edit the above file!
# add the line
#   t.string :first_name

# Update the schema file again, there are now two files in db/migrate
# Check version on scheme whenever unsure if migration yet occured
$   rake db:migrate


# Let's test our API

$   rails c
$   @author = Author.new
$   @author = Author.last_name = "Martin"

# Oops, accidental \n in there!
$   @author = Author.first_name = "George R. R.
$   "

# Let's fix it.
# The ! on chomp will actually change the existing record.
$   @author = Author.first_name.chomp!

# Save our Author, write to db
$   @author.save

# Find George!
$   @george = Author.find(1

# For now, this'll be exact match
$   @find_george = Author.find_by_first_name("George")

# It returned nothing.
  => nil
