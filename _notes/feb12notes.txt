# How most professionals do it, generating a model rather than scaffold
# Remember adage: Convention Over Configuration


# Create migration file
rails g model Book title:string

# And now update the schema file
rake db:migrate

# No views or controllers exist yet, no routes to find.

# Added last_name, intentionally forgot first_name:string
rails g model Author last_name:string

# This generated db/migrate/20180212235656_create_authors.rb

# Oh no! We "forgot" first_name:string! Quick, edit the above file!
